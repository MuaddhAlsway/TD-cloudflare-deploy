# PRD — TD Logistics Dual-Audience Website

## 1) Background

TD Logistics needs a professional website that serves both B2C end-customers seeking fast shipment tracking and B2B e-commerce clients looking for reliable logistics partnerships. Current market solutions force businesses to choose between consumer-friendly interfaces and professional B2B presentations, creating missed opportunities for lead generation and customer satisfaction. This addresses the Charter's core problems of logistics uncertainty and service inconsistencies by providing transparent, accessible communication channels that build trust with both audience segments simultaneously. This is the right time to launch because TD Logistics has established operational excellence and needs digital presence to match their service quality and capture market growth in Saudi Arabia's expanding e-commerce sector.

## 2) Objectives & Desired Outcomes

- **Seamless Dual Experience**: Both Aisha (B2C) and Khalid (B2B) find their specific needs immediately addressed without compromising the other's experience through intelligent information architecture and prominent feature placement.
- **Trust and Credibility Building**: Potential B2B clients gain confidence in TD Logistics' capabilities through authentic visual evidence, client testimonials, and professional service presentation, while end-customers feel secure about their shipment handling.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Customer service load decreases as users find answers and take actions independently through self-service tracking, comprehensive service information, and accessible support channels.
- **Lead Generation Success**: Qualified B2B prospects submit detailed quote requests with sufficient information for sales team follow-up, while existing clients easily access account management features.
- **Non-goals / Boundaries**: This iteration focuses on information presentation and lead capture rather than full client portal functionality or real-time logistics system integration.

## 3) Users & Stories

- **Primary Persona:** Aisha Al-Mahmoud (B2C End-Customer)
  - Story A: As Aisha, I want to quickly enter my tracking number on the homepage and see clear delivery status, so I can plan my schedule and feel confident about my purchase.
  - Story B: As Aisha, I want to instantly connect with customer support through WhatsApp or chat when I have delivery concerns, so I can resolve issues without phone wait times.

## 4) Key Feature

## 6) Competitive Analysis

- **Landscape (who is solving this problem):** SAL (Saudi Post), Aramex, DHL Express, SMSA Express serve logistics needs with consumer or B2B focus, manual alternatives include direct delivery or multiple vendor relationships, and generic logistics companies provide basic tracking without specialization.

- **Value Thesis (each player's proposition):** SAL offers government-backed reliability but limited B2B specialization, Aramex provides international reach with complex pricing, DHL focuses on premium express services for large businesses, SMSA offers local market knowledge with traditional service models, while manual solutions provide control but require significant operational overhead.

- **Strengths / Weaknesses (experience pros/cons):** SAL has simple tracking interface but lacks B2B partnership focus, international carriers offer comprehensive services but with complexity that overwhelms smaller businesses, local competitors provide market knowledge but often lack professional digital presence and modern customer experience standards.

- **Our Differentiators (our unique points):** TD Logistics combines reliability and professional excellence with clarity and simplicity to serve both audiences equally well through authentic leadership demonstration, offering high-touch service quality with accessible technology interfaces, specializing in Saudi market needs without the complexity or generic approach of larger competitors.

- **Switching Costs & Risks (migration costs and risks):** B2B clients face integration effort and relationship rebuilding when changing logistics partners, while end-customers may resist learning new tracking systems, requiring TD to demonstrate superior value and smooth onboarding processes.

- **Notes (reference links):** sal.sa tracking interface for homepage design reference, competitor service pages for capability comparison, client testimonial examples from established logistics providers for trust-building inspiration.
