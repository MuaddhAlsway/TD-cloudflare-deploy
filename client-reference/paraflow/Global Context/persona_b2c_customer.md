## About Aisha

Aisha is a marketing coordinator who frequently shops online for both personal items and gifts for family members. She has grown frustrated with unreliable delivery services that provide poor tracking information and lack accessible customer support. She values her time highly and expects the same level of service from logistics companies that she receives from the best e-commerce platforms she shops from.

## Behavioral Considerations

- Expects immediate access to tracking information without creating accounts or remembering login credentials
- Checks shipment status multiple times throughout the delivery process, especially for time-sensitive orders
- Prefers instant messaging (WhatsApp) or chat over phone calls for customer service interactions
- Becomes anxious when tracking information is unclear or when deliveries are delayed without notification

## Frustrations

- Cannot easily find or access shipment tracking information when she needs it most
- Customer service is difficult to reach when she has delivery issues or complaints
- Tracking updates are vague or infrequent, leaving her uncertain about delivery timing
- Has to remember multiple tracking systems and websites for different logistics providers

## Goals

- Quickly and easily check the status of her shipments from anywhere, at any time
- Get immediate help when delivery issues arise without lengthy phone waits
- Receive proactive notifications about delivery updates or potential delays

## Tasks

- Enter tracking number to check shipment status and estimated delivery time
- Access customer support when packages are delayed or have delivery issues
- Track multiple simultaneous orders from different merchants using TD Logistics
- Receive and confirm delivery notifications
- Report delivery problems or request redelivery scheduling
